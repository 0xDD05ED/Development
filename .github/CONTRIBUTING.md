MultiChat is a piece of software that has evolved from a simple staff chat plugin. It is entirely my own work to this point (19/09/2018) and I have always dictated the direction of the software.

In the coming updates I am planning lots of new features, and some of them are quite large. I hence wanted to open the possibility for others to contribute to the plugin.

Firstly, I will not accept random pull requests. If you want to add a feature to the plugin please speak to me first. I don't want MultiChat to become bloated with features that should belong elsewhere.

Secondly, please understand the codebase of the plugin is not always well documented or even well designed in the first place. When I started MultiChat I barely knew how to program in Java, I have now completed nearly a whole Computer Science degree and know what I am doing. I am making a lot of progress in updating and refactoring the oldest parts of the plugin, but some areas are, frankly, horribly written. So please don't tell me that the plugin is badly coded, yes some areas aren't pretty to look at, but it works. And I am working hard to make the code as elegant as possible. If you want to help with this process then I would be open to pull requests which update older sections of code to reflect better industry standards.

And finally, I just want to say I can be picky. I'm sorry, I won't deny it. If I look at what you've written and it isn't quite what I want, I will say so. I however will not outright reject things like that, I will look at it and figure out the best way to put it into the plugin. I am a bit protective of this plugin, so please try and make sure that your pull requests obey simple java coding practices and don't introduce any terrible bugs.

I think thats all I want to say here for now...

Please don't be put off from contributing by anything I've said here, I really do welcome almost anything!

But for the best results, talk to me first before spending hours coding something I might not be too keen on.

Thanks for supporting the plugin, and I look forward to your contributions!
