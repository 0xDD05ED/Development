## Does this pull request seem to stay true to the style used so far in the MultiChat code.

This is not to say you MUST code exactly as I do. But programs should have consistency, both in the actual code, and in documentation.
Some specific examples of 'style' choices in the MultiChat code are as follows:

Curly braces should in general NOT be opened on their own line.

E.g.
```java
if ( ... ) {
}
```
NOT
```java
if ( ... )
{
}
```
Comments should be written where possible and should have a space after the //

E.g.
```java
// This is a comment
```
NOT
```java
//This is a comment
```
